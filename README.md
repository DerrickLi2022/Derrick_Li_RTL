1. At Microsoft, I worked on the RTL design of firewall and address decoder modules inside Network on Chip (NoC) which is a next-generation SoC interconnect. The project focused on implementing secure and efficient memory and CSRs access control between multiple AXI masters and slaves. I developed Verilog RTL for the address decoder and programmable access control logic. The design enforced per-master access permissions, reduced access violations, and achieved low-latency address decoding optimized for synthesis and timing.
2. I have hands-on experience with Verilog RTL design, waveform debugging using Synopsys Verdi, and timing synthesis using Synopsys Fusion Compiler. I developed and verified synthesizable RTL modules, then used Verdi extensively to trace signal activity, analyze bus transactions, and debug functional mismatches by correlating waveforms with source code and hierarchy views. For backend preparation, I performed timing synthesis and optimization with Fusion Compiler, analyzing timing reports, identifying critical paths, and applying design or constraint changes to close setup and hold violations. This end-to-end flow gave me strong proficiency in connecting front-end design, simulation, and physical timing closure.
